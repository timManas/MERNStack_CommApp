Notes for this lesson

1. "next" dependecies is a framework which helps users build the framework which would normally rrequire alot of code and configuraion.
Referred to as Zero configuration framework 
- Not a replacement for React.
- Helps build react framework faster 
- Supports hot code reloading
- Very similar to CreateReactApp

2. Difference between NextJS vs CreateReactApp
- Next uses Server side rendering while CreateReactApp uses client side rendering
- From a performance perspective, NextJS is faster loading application

3. When an application first load, it can use SSR(NextJS) to fetch the data which can move over to CSR. This is because NextJS is isomorphic/universal rendering 

2. When building applications, we can utilize a component library called SemanticUI React
 
Related to next.js
