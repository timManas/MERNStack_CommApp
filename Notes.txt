Notes for this lesson

1. "next" dependecies is a framework which helps users build the framework which would normally rrequire alot of code and configuraion.
Referred to as Zero configuration framework 
- Not a replacement for React.
- Helps build react framework faster 
- Supports hot code reloading
- Very similar to CreateReactApp

2. Difference between NextJS vs CreateReactApp
- Next uses Server side rendering while CreateReactApp uses client side rendering
- From a performance perspective, NextJS is faster loading application

3. When an application first load, it can use SSR(NextJS) to fetch the data which can move over to CSR. This is because NextJS is isomorphic/universal rendering 

2. When building applications, we can utilize a component library called SemanticUI React
 
4. nProgress is a dependency library which helps displays a progress bar when we switch between different pages

5. Since React 16.7, we have the ability to make request to an external API from FUNCTIONAL components using React Hooks. 

6. useEffect is performing an API call to the outside world (ex. Server)5. Since React 16.7, we have the ability to make request to an external API from FUNCTIONAL components using React Hooks. 


7. In JS, static methods can be accessed classes 

8. You can import data into MongoDB using mongoImport... Go to mongoDB website > Command line tools > Data Import and Export Tools  > copy package monogoimport 

9. return <Card.Group  stackable itemsPerRow="3" centered items={mapProductsToItems(products)} /> 
- Here you set the individual card component using semantic-UI
- You also set 3 card per row
- You also allow for stackable responsive UI for mobile devices. Hence it doesn't looks weird on phones

10. In order to use state, you will need to use "React" 

11. we use an inline function "() =>" so that it doesn't execute the code when it first mounts

12. Use bcrypt to hash a password
